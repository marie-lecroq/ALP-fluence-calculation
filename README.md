## Summary

Code authors: Marie Lecroq, Sebastian Hoof, and Csaba Bal&aacute;zs.

This repo contains code for calculating the expected fluence from decays of axion-like particles into photons after SN 1987A, based on the Monte Carlo simulations described in ref. [[2]](#res2).

Axion-like particles (ALPs) are produced in supernovae and subsequently decay into two photons or convert into photons inside magnetic fields on their way towards Earth. The non-observation [[3]](#data) of a such photons from the direction of SN 1987A can be used to place limits on the ALP-photon coupling [[4]](#res1). We focus on ALPs with masses of keV to GeV and reproduce and extend the work presented in ref. [[2]](#res2).

</p>

The figure above shows the 3 &sigma; limit obtained from using our Monte Carlo routines (black line). The blue dashed line shows the limits obtained by ref. [[2]](#res2) for comparison; they only considered ALP masses up to 100 MeV and ALP-photon couplings up to 10<sup>-9</sup> GeV<sup>-1</sup>. Our fluxes tend to be higher than in ref. [[2]](#res2) by a factor of about 1.8 in agreement with ref. [[5]](#update). The figure can be produced with the [`plot_likelihood.py`](results/plot_likelihood.py) script.

## The code

The code implements a full Monte Carlo simulation without any rescaling factors. Details about the theoretical computations and the code can be found in [the documentation](documentation.pdf). The Python code was developed with Python version 3.5.7 and only rely on standard packages such as `numpy` and `scipy`.

The file [`fluence_calc_mc.py`](code/fluence_calc_mc.py) contains the function `expected_photon_fluence(m, g, verbose=0)`, which computes the expected photon flunce (in cm<sup>-2</sup>) given and ALP mass `m` (in eV) and ALP-photon coupling `g` (in GeV<sup>-1</sup>). A parallel run of the code can be invoked by `mpiexec python run_analysis_mpi.py`.
